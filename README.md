# AdoptSJHFH
Adoption System for City Hall

## Abstract
The iOS app AdoptSJ was designed and developed in 24 hours during the Hack for Humanity 2017 @ Santa Clara University.
The idea behind the app is to let people easily adopt public properties through a simple Google PlacePicker API implementation,
which then populates a form for the user to fill out. Upon completion, the app sends an email template with the given
information to the City of San Jose. The paperwork is then filed, and the user maintains the property by picking up trash or
removing weeds, providing the equivalent of free labor for city maintenance.
